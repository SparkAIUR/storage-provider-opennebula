# Decisions

## 2026-09-09, CephFS recovery

- HUMAN: Keep AMD's shared CephFS PVC and `/data/tmp`; do not migrate temp storage to `emptyDir`.
- HUMAN: Drain the affected Frauditor global-search worker before replacing CSI on `hplbravoxla02`.
- HUMAN: Release the validated fix as v0.5.28.
- AI: Preserve existing CSI response contracts and v0.5.27 session files. Use kubelet's adjacent `vol_data.json` and mountinfo identities to establish ownership.
- AI: Use foreground FUSE clients so startup cancellation can terminate the client and the driver can reap and report exits. Application containers retaining old mount namespaces need storage liveness probes or a controlled restart.
- AI: Keep chart publication separate from the Bravo canary until wildcard consumers are held on their existing version.
